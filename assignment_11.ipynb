    "Using logging messages instead of print statements offers several advantages in terms of flexibility, control, and maintainability:\n",
    "1 . Log Levels: The logging provides different log levels that allow us to categorize our messages based on priority. With print statements we have to do it manually.\n",
    "2. Control and configuration: The logging module allows us to configure various aspects of logging, such as output destination (e.g., console, file), log formatting, timestamp inclusion, and more. With print statements, you have limited control over these aspects and would need to implement custom logic to achieve similar functionality.\n",
    "3. Log message timestamping: Logging automatically includes timestamps in log messages, which can be helpful for understanding the sequence of events during program execution. In contrast, with print statements, we would need to manually include timestamps if desired.\n"

    "#Answer:\n",
    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger are used for program execution control during debugging sessions. Here are the differences between these three buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Over: The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code and move to the next line in a single step. If the current line contains a function call, the debugger will execute the entire function without diving into its implementation. In other words, it \"steps over\" the function call, treating it as a single step and moves to the next line in the current scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step In: The Step In button is used to dive into the implementation of a function call. When you encounter a function call during debugging and click Step In, the debugger will move to the first line of the called function, allowing you to debug through the function's code. This allows for a detailed inspection and debugging of the function's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: The Step Out button is used to quickly move out of the current function being debugged and return to the caller. It allows you to skip the remaining execution of the current function and return to the line where the function was called. This can be useful when you are deep within a function's execution and want to quickly jump back to the calling code."
